About me
======

I’m a Belgian citizen living in France, with an American education. I have been passionate for IT as far as I can remember. I remember getting a Hayes modem for my 16th birthday and that was one of the best presents I have ever received. Maybe rivaled by a Chromecast device offered by my son a few years back ;-)

My first real job in IT was a long time ago, in 1993, at Schlumberger. I was part time developer on IBM’s mini system AS/400, part time hotliner, and part time handling user training on the programs my team and I were developing. Atypical job…but atypical is fitting.

 From there, I joined a team that was working on water meter reading from a distance. I worked on projects that seem so “obvious” today, but at the time, personal computers had not yet made their way in the office. I had the odd job of replacing AS/400 terminals by PCs, and setting up the AS/400 emulators so not to upset the end-users. I also witnessed the arrival of TCP/IP, e-mail, Ethernet…as I said, everything that sounds so common nowadays. I also encountered linux at that time. 
If memory serves, the kernel was 0.98 and the distro was Slackware. I might still have the CDs in an attic somewhere.

My very first manager was a heavy figured bearded guy who intimidated me to say the least. He was tough, and so rough I thought at the time he hated me. But when Schlumberger decided to regroup all the best computer wizes from all the different IT departments, that boss came to see me and told me I had to join, he didn’t know a better candidate. I was shocked, and pleased ^^

I did join that new internal company. I was so eager to work with the best that I accepted the first position they proposed. Even though looking back at my career, I have zero regrets, the guy I am today would not have played it that way. My first job in that company was helpdesker. We see level 1 support as the lowest position in IT, and though that may be true, I don’t think I have ever laughed as much as during that time. We were three working on a site hosting 2700 users, we were very busy, but we had the best time.

Eight months after, I became desktop support technician. Not as fun as the helpdesk that is for sure but the job had its perks. When I wasn’t playing computer games setting up LAN parties with my friends over the weekends, I would volunteer for VIP seminars with Schlumberger where I had to setup the IT infrastructure for users over the weekend; CISCO routers for internet connection, a printer and Active Directory servers for authentication (and printing).

I held that job for about a year and a half, and then joined the Windows server team. I gained a lot of knowledge there. The team was great. But I had aspirations to work on Unix systems…and clearly both Windows and Unix teams were far apart, not in distance, but in spirit. I spoke with a buddy in the Unix team and he told me, “if one day you want to make it on the other side, I suggest you learn DNS and bind”. I read all I could find on bind. Theoretically DNS had no more secrets for me. I was put to the test by going on an oil rig where the IT manager (the only IT guy on the whole platform) had major IT issues, and a non-working DNS server. 
What an amazing experience! And the way I was greeted by all the guys there was just as amazing. They loved me. As they said “I was the guy that was bringing them porn”. Haha ^^

My buddy from the Unix team left the company. The perfect opportunity for me to step in and tell them I could take his place. I knew DNS inside and out, I’d have to learn mail servers…but how hard could that be? I got the job. I was everything I had hoped for, and more. The other Unix team members also left the company and I found myself the unique member of the team. Hard times… About a year in, we greeted a new member. This guy was simply above the heard. Probably one of the most intelligent guys I have ever worked with. He learned Perl in a few weeks and he was doing some really cool things with the language. I was intrigued. And it had been a long time since I had done some programming. I missed it.

I picked up the O’Reilly Camel book and read it like a novel. I was introduced to LDAP at the same time. I fell in love with both Perl and LDAP and have written since hundreds of scripts related to LDAP. Such powerful stuff! My company (the IT part of Schlumberger) was sold off to Atos, as Schlumberger wanted to refocus on their main revenue stream, petroleum. At first Atos seemed like it was going to be horrible ^^ I was in a Unix department, but mainly occupied on backups and more boring tasks. But, being able to see the positive in every situation, I did not despair. In fact, I got there just in time. They had a huge development project around backups and reading the output logs and feeding the information to a system that would provide a daily dashboard on the status of last night’s backups. I worked with a colleague on this project, bringing all my theoretical Perl knowledge to the table. You guessed it, it was a success. I never considered anything else.

Once the project was done, I left that department to join a team of Unix experts. They were working on everything I love the most in IT; infrastructure. I felt right at home in my element. So much so that I stayed there for eight years. There was so much to learn, so much to do, surrounded by bright minds. I also had an incredible manager. A guy who for the first time showed me there was a difference between a leader and a manager. What a leader he was! But life has its plans…and he eventually got retired from his position due to internal politics. At that moment, he was leading a major project, and he asked the team if anyone was interested picking up the project. No volunteers. So I went to see him and told him I would do it. He was more than surprised, here I was, a total linux geek, developing tools and websites, willing to give it all up for a Windows PC, and making Excel and Outlook my main tools.

That’s how I became project manager. The project was huge indeed. 
Consisting in designing and setting up a new and modern e-mail system for Atos worldwide. I had a year before meeting the deadline. The project was a complete success. I learned a lot during that year, technically for sure, but obviously mainly in project management. The importance of writing meeting minutes was learned the hard way. 
Apparently the first rule of all project managers…but when I think of how the job fell on me, I’m not surprised some rules passed me by. Never mind. I learned my lesson and would not get fooled by anyone pretending not having said what they said after that. The project was such a success that Atos’ DSI asked me to lead a comparable project when they merged with Bull. I had 18 months this time. Just enough to reach success. Of course, I was an atypical project manager, very tech savvy, willing and able to help out technical teams in order to achieve my given goals.

I never stopped leading projects. Even today, while being SDM, working for another company, I still lead projects. I became SDM kind of the same way I became everything else before that. Via an opportunity.

It’ll be almost ten years that I’m SDM. I can still get down and dirty with the nitty gritty technical issues. Even now that I work with a team of DevOps engineers focused on CloudOps. Between two projects, or two phone calls with customers or team members, I managed to learn Ansible, a fantastic solution aimed at automating deployments of software/middleware.

I don’t know what is next, but I do know there is more to come ;-)
