About me
======


I am a Belgian by birth, residing in France, and carrying the knowledge and experience shaped by an American education. My journey into the world of Information Technology began when I received a Hayes modem on my 16th birthday, a present that sparked a lifelong passion.

My early career took off at Schlumberger in 1993, wearing multiple hats from development on IBMâ€™s AS/400 system to customer support and training. This eclectic mix of responsibilities was a great fit for my atypical nature. I then contributed to pioneering projects in remote water meter reading, a field that now seems standard, but was innovative back then. My adventure with Linux began alongside witnessing foundational technologies like TCP/IP, email, and Ethernet becoming staples.

Surprisingly promoted by a formidable first manager who recognized my potential, I joined an elite internal team within Schlumberger. Starting as a helpdesk operator, a role often underrated but thoroughly enjoyable, my career took a technical leap to desktop support and then to the Windows server team. Yet, Unix systems called to me; I mastered DNS and bind, leading to a challenging stint solving IT issues on an oil rig.

Opportunity knocked when I transitioned into the Unix team at Schlumberger, which eventually became a solo venture. Embracing Perl and LDAP, I developed a strong proficiency in scripting. Schlumberger's IT division's transition to Atos opened new doors. I dived into development projects, revamping backup systems, and later stepped up to join a team of Unix experts, indulging my passion for IT infrastructure for eight fruitful years.

A twist of fate led me to project management, where I spearheaded the design and implementation of a modern email system for Atos, followed by a similar project after their merger with Bull. My atypical approach combined technical expertise with project leadership.

Today, as a Service Delivery Manager (SDM), I balance project management with hands-on technical troubleshooting and strategy. Even amidst project timelines and customer calls, I found the time to master Ansible, embracing the power of automation for software deployments.

Every role has been an opportunity, and I eagerly anticipate what the future holds, knowing that my technology voyage is far from over.
